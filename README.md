# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview:

Following the analysis of the PyBer ride share data we were charged with creating a ride-sharing summary DataFrame based on city type. We were also tasked with creating a multiple line graph that depicted the total weekly
fares for each city type from 2019-01-01 to 2019-04-28.

## Results:

As shown above there are a number of differences between the 3 different city types. Foremost it would appear that drivers who service the rural cities make the most money and the fares are the most expensive in this location. However, 
this can be explained due to there being fewer drivers than total rides within the rural area. Meanwhile, the urban cities have the lowest avg fare per ride and lowest avg fare per driver which can be explained by the fact that there are far 
more drivers than rides with the urban area. Similarly, this reasoning can be used to explain the suburban cities which would have a lower avg fare per ride and lower avg fare per driver if the locations were staffed more. However, the weekly 
fare by city type (and total fare amount) is actually reversed with urban cities contributing the most revenue among the city types and rural cities contributing the least amount.  

## Summary:

### Recommendations

-First, we need to address the disparity among the urban drivers and total urban rides. The company currently has too many drivers allocated to the urban cities. Either the number of drivers needs to be cut back in these locations or the company
needs to find a way to raise the number of rides within this city type. 

-Next, both the rural cities and suburban cities are understaffed. To address this the company could hire more individuals in these locations or see if some of the urban drivers would be willing to relocate to these areas. The later option would
address 2 issues at once, although it might be hard to get individuals to relocate. 

-Finally, to increase the number of rides in both rural and suburban areas the company might think of lowering the ride prices in these locations to attract more customers in these areas. Even though these city types are typically less populated 
the company might be able to raise the number of total rides in both areas and thus the revenue as well.
